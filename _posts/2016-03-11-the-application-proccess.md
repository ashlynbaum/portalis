Immigration presented an opportunity that the accredited employer scheme needs to be improved. Instead of jumping to solutions we wanted to spend time understanding the problem. The first step for this was mapping out the process of an application.

## Enter sticky-notes

To visualize the process, the simplest way for me to begin mapping things out was on paper.

We worked with immigration to try to understand every step in the process from a company printing out the application, all the way to acceptance. 

## People Power
There is a surprising amount of human element to the process. First the application is completely processed by a human. A human receives a paper application, then manually sends emails, responses, hand enters the information into a computer system. Everything is stored as paper. But judgment of weather the information provided meets the policy instruction is determined by a human, then checked again by another human.

## Should this be digital?
Automation of this process is something that we are researching. Realistically the information is received in analog, entered into a computer, then printed out, then re-entered into a computer, then printed, and then the digital data is updated again. The flow of information is not efficient in its current form.

Some of the problems that come up when we research making this a digital application is risk mitigation. Security and verification of documents play one role; but the main issue is the verification that the documents provided are actually what meet the policy instruction. This is because there are many different ways that the data can be presented.
